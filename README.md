"Hopper" (blimp) for Design Nature

All first-year students at Olin get to take a class called Design Nature, 
in which we are challenged to create a biologically-inspired hopping creation from a very limited list of parts.

Taking inspiration from nature, I noticed that the insects that reach the greatest heights and distances
do so by flying. A particulary enlightening example are spiders, some species of which can spin silk
balloons to loft themselves thousands of feet in the air and travel many miles.

Utilizing the presence of tap water in the list, and the general allowance on using tools to alter the given materials,
I have decided to split the H2O to make hydrogen, then use that to lift a blimp hundreds of feet in the air.

This is still a work in progress, and success is far from certain. This repository contains all the CAD 
and many of the calculations necessary to move forward.
